# 100Devs Homework Tracker

This tracker is a little tool I built for myself because I didn't keep up with the homework as I watched the videos. It contains far less information than other resources because I wanted something that focused exclusively on homework. If you're in need of links to class videos, follow along materials, slides, etc, check out [100 Devs Follow Along](https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/index.html) or [100 Devs Course List](https://winchy82dev.notion.site/12268a73ea854ae9bff22660d8a42274?v=403f5589c3734d09a3874648dfcb86fa), and huge credit goes to the author of [this homework checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaPpSFaypHasG5piX8bCsitQOpz9yqtF/edit#) (if anyone knows the author, please let me know!) which I used as my main source of information.
